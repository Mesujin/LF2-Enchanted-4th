## Description
This is the source of `LF2 Enchanted 4th (LF2EF)`'s Platform and Engine.

## Modify & Build
To modify, generally you'll need [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), 2019 or higher. <br/>
If you're not familiar with GitHub, here's the link to download this source. <br/>
> Download Source : https://github.com/Mesujin/LF2-Enchanted-4th/archive/refs/heads/Official_Release.zip

You might missing something if you're purely download the source instead of clone it.

<br/>

In modifying the source, you could start from `platform.cpp`, but everything else about the game is located in `engine.h`. <br/>
Make sure to build this source with `Release` setup. <br/>


To run this source after you build it, you'll need to copy the data from the game (simply everything in the "System") as it doesn't included here, but don't overwrite.
