## Modify & Install
To start modifying, you'll need [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), 2019 or higher. <br/>
In modifying, you could start from `main.cpp`, but everything else about the game is located in `engine.h`. <br/>
Make sure to build this source with `Release` setup. <br/>
To run this source after you build it, you'll need to copy the "[System.as](https://github.com/Mesujin/LF2-Enchanted-3rd-AI-and-System/)" and copy other datas from the game (simply everything in the "Database") as it doesn't included here. <br/>
